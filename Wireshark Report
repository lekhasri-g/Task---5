# Task 5 “Wireshark Capture & Analysis"


- **OS / Tool:** Wireshark vX.X on <Windows/Linux/macOS>

---

## Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark, identify at least 3 protocols, analyze sample packets, and prepare a short report.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark and verified packet capture permissions.
2. Started capture on the active interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
3. Generated traffic using:
   - `ping google.com`
   - `nslookup example.com` / `dig example.com`
   - `curl http://neverssl.com`
   - Browser visits to `http://neverssl.com` and `https://example.com`
4. Stopped capture after ~1 minute and saved as `task5_capture_LekhaSri.pcap`.
5. Used Wireshark display filters (`dns`, `http`, `tls`) for analysis.
6. Exported findings and screenshots into `report_task5.pdf`.

---

## Protocols Identified
- **DNS** â€“ X packets â€“ Example Packet #___  
- **HTTP** â€“ Y packets â€“ Example Packet #___  
- **TLS** â€“ Z packets â€“ Example Packet #___  

---

## Key Findings
- Captured live packets successfully.
- Identified DNS, HTTP, and TLS protocols.
- Learned how to use display filters for deeper inspection.
